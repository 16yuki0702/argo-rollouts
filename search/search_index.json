Argo Rollouts introduces a new custom resource called a Rollout to provide additional deployment strategies such as Blue Green and Canary to Kubernetes. The Rollout custom resource provides feature parity with the deployment resource with additional deployment strategies. Check out the Deployment Concepts for more information on the various deployment strategies. Why Argo Rollouts? Deployments resources offer two strategies to deploy changes: RollingUpdate and Recreate . While these strategies can solve a wide number of use cases, large scale production deployments use additional strategies, such as blue-green or canary, that are missing from the Deployment controller. In order to use these strategies in Kubernetes, users are forced to build scripts on top of their deployments. The Argo Rollouts controller provides these strategies as simple declarative, configurable, GitOps-friendly options. Getting Started Quick Start Argo Rollouts can be installed by running the following commands: $ kubectl create namespace argo-rollouts $ kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/stable/manifests/install.yaml Check out the getting started guide to walk through creating and then updating a rollout object. How does it work? Similar to the deployment object, the Argo Rollouts controller will manage the creation, scaling, and deletion of ReplicaSets. These ReplicaSets are defined by the spec.template field, which uses the same pod template as the deployment object. When the spec.template is changed, that signals to the Argo Rollouts controller that a new ReplicaSet will be introduced. The controller will use the strategy set within the spec.strategy field in order to determine how the rollout will progress from the old ReplicaSet to the new ReplicaSet. Once that new ReplicaSet has successfully progressed into the stable version, that Rollout will be marked as the stable ReplicaSet. If another change occurs in the spec.template during a transition from a stable ReplicaSet to a new ReplicaSet. The previously new ReplicaSet will be scaled down, and the controller will try to progress the ReplicasSet that reflects the spec.template field. There is more information on the behaviors of each strategy in the spec section. Use cases of Argo Rollouts A user wants to run last minute functional tests on the new version before it starts to serve production traffic. With the BlueGreen strategy, Argo Rollouts allow users to specify a preview service and an active service. The Rollout will configure the preview service to send traffic to the new version while the active service continues to receive production traffic. Once a user is satisfied, they can promote the preview service to be the new active service. ( example ) Before a new version starts receiving live traffic, a generic set of steps need to be executed beforehand. With the BlueGreen Strategy, the user can bring up the new version without it receiving traffic from the active service. Once those steps finish executing, the rollout can cut over traffic to the new version. A user wants to give a small percentage of the production traffic to a new version of their application for a couple of hours. Afterward, they want to scale down the new version and look at some metrics to determine if the new version is performant compared to the old version. Then they will decide if they want to rollout the new version for all of the production traffic or stick with the current version. With the canary strategy, the rollout can scale up a replica with the new version to receive a specified percentage of traffic, wait for a specified amount of time, set the percentage back to 0, and then wait to rollout out to service all of the traffic once the user is satisfied. ( example ) A user wants to slowly give the new version more production traffic. They start by giving it a small percentage of the live traffic and wait a while before giving the new version more traffic. Eventually, the new version will receive all the production traffic. With the canary strategy, the user specifies the percentages they want the new version to receive and the amount of time to wait between percentages. ( example A user wants to use the normal Rolling Update strategy from the deployment. If a user uses the canary strategy with no steps, the rollout will use the max surge and max unavailable values to roll to the new version.

Recreate A Recreate deployment deletes the old version of the application before bring up the new version.

Blue Green A Blue Green deployment (which is sometimes referred to as a Red-Black) has both the new and old version of the application deployed at the same time. During this time, only the old version of the application will receive production traffic. This allows the developers to run tests against the new version before switching the live traffic to the new version. Canary A Canary deployment exposes a subset of users (usually 5%) to the new version of the application while serving the rest of the traffic to the old version.

Install Argo Rollouts Argo Rollouts can be installed at a cluster or namespace level. Cluster-Level installation kubectl create namespace argo-rollouts kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/stable/manifests/install.yaml This will create a new namespace, argo-rollouts , where Argo Rollouts controller will live.

If you would like to install Argo Rollouts in another namespace, you will need to modify the ClusterRoleBinding resource that binds the ClusterRole to the ServiceAcccount created. The namespace for the ServiceAccount referenced in the ClusterRoleBinding needs to be modified to match your desired namespace. Namespace-Level Installation kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/stable/manifests/namespace-install.yaml Converting Deployment to Rollout Converting a Deployment to a Rollout simply is a core design principle of Argo Rollouts. There are two key changes: Changing the apiVersion value to argoproj.io/v1alpha1 and changing the kind value from Deployment to Rollout Adding a new deployment strategy to the new Rollout. You can read up on the available strategies at Argo Rollouts section Below is an example of a Rollout YAML using the Canary strategy. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 # Changed from apps/v1 kind : Rollout # Changed from Deployment # ----- Everything below this comment is the same as a deployment ----- metadata : name : example-rollout spec : replicas : 5 selector : matchLabels : app : nginx template : metadata : labels : app : nginx spec : containers : - name : nginx image : nginx:1.15.4 ports : - containerPort : 80 minReadySeconds : 30 revisionHistoryLimit : 3 strategy : # ----- Everything above this comment are the same as a deployment ----- canary : # A new field that used to provide configurable options for a Canary strategy steps : - setWeight : 20 - pause : {} Updating the Rollout The initial creation of the above Rollout will bring up all 5 replicas of the Pod Spec listed. Since the rollout was not in a stable state beforehand (as it was just created), the rollout will skip the steps listed in the .spec.strategy.canary.steps field to first become stable. Once the new ReplicaSet is healthy, updating any field in the spec.template will cause the rollout to create a new ReplicaSet and execute the steps in spec.strategy.canary.steps to transition to the new version. To demonstrate this, we will update the rollout to use a new nginx image. You can either run kubectl edit rollout example-rollout and change the image from nginx:1.15.4 to nginx:1.15.5 , or run the following: $ kubectl patch rollout example-rollout --type merge -p { spec : { template : { spec : { containers : [{ name : nginx , image : nginx:1.15.5 }]}}}} Once the patch is applied, you can watch the new replicaset came up as healthy by running $ kubectl get replicaset -w -o wide Once that replicaset is healthy, the rollout will enter a paused state by adding a pause condition to .status.pauseConditions . The pause condition contains a reason and a pause start time. Promoting the rollout The rollout does not continue progessing to the new version until the pause conditon is removed from the status. Since the rollout YAML submitted does not have a duration within the pause step, the Rollout is paused indefinitely until a external process (i.e. a user or automiated tool) removes the pause conditon. Argo Rollouts has a kubectl plugin to help automate operations like promoting a rollout through a step. The installation instructions are here . Once the plugin is installed, the user can run the following command to promote the rollout through the pause step: kubectl argo rollouts promote example-rollout At this point, the Rollout has executed all the steps to transition to a new version.

This document describes how to achieve various forms of progressive delivery, varying the point in time analysis is performed, it's frequency, and occurrence. Custom Resource Definitions CRD Description Rollout A Rollout acts as a drop-in replacement for a Deployment resource. It provides additional blueGreen and canary update strategies. These strategies can create AnalysisRuns and Experiments during the update, which will progress the update, or abort it. AnalysisTemplate An AnalysisTemplate is a template spec which defines how to perform a canary analysis, such as the metrics which it should perform, its frequency, and the values which are considered successful or failed. AnalysisTemplates may be parameterized with inputs values. AnalysisRun An AnalysisRun is an instantiation of an AnalysisTemplate . AnalysisRuns are like Jobs in that they eventually complete. Completed runs are considered Successful, Failed, or Inconclusive, and the result of the run affect if the Rollout's update will continue, abort, or pause, respectively. Experiment An Experiment is limited run of one or more ReplicaSets for the purposes of analysis. Experiments typically run for a pre-determined duration, but can also run indefinitely until stopped. Experiments may reference an AnalysisTemplate to run during or after the experiment. The canonical use case for an Experiment is to start a baseline and canary deployment in parallel, and compare the metrics produced by the baseline and canary pods for an equal comparison. Background Analysis Analysis can be run in the background -- while the canary is progressing through its rollout steps. The following example gradually increments the canary weight by 20% every 10 minutes until it reaches 100%. In the background, an AnalysisRun is started based on the AnalysisTemplate named success-rate . The success-rate template queries a prometheus server, measuring the HTTP success rates at 5 minute intervals/samples. It has no end time, and continues until stopped or failed. If the metric is measured to be less than 95%, and there are three such measurements, the analysis is considered Failed. The failed analysis causes the Rollout to abort, setting the canary weight back to zero, and the Rollout would be considered in a Degraded . Otherwise, if the rollout completes all of its canary steps, the rollout is considered successful and the analysis run is stopped by the controller. This example highlights: * background analysis style of progressive delivery * using a prometheus query to perform a measurement * the ability to parameterize the analysis apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : guestbook spec : ... strategy : canary : analysis : templateName : success-rate # NOTE: a field may be introduced to delay starting analysis run until a specified step is reached. # (e.g.: startingStepIndex: 1) arguments : - name : service-name value : guestbook-svc.default.svc.cluster.local steps : - setWeight : 20 - pause : { duration : 600 } - setWeight : 40 - pause : { duration : 600 } - setWeight : 60 - pause : { duration : 600 } - setWeight : 80 - pause : { duration : 600 } apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AnalysisTemplate metadata : name : success-rate spec : inputs : - name : service-name metrics : - name : success-rate interval : 5m successCondition : result = 0.95 failureLimit : 3 prometheus : address : http://prometheus.example.com:9090 query : | sum(irate( istio_requests_total{reporter= source ,destination_service=~ {{inputs.service-name}} ,response_code!~ 5.* }[5m] )) / sum(irate( istio_requests_total{reporter= source ,destination_service=~ {{inputs.service-name}} }[5m] )) Analysis at a Predefined Step Analysis can also be performed as a rollout step as a \"analysis\" step. When analysis is performed as a step, an AnalysisRun is started when the step is reached, and blocks the rollout until the run is completed. The success or failure of the analysis run decides if the rollout will proceed to the next step, or abort the rollout completely. This example sets the canary weight to 20%, pauses for 5 minutes, then runs an analysis. If the analysis was successful, continues with rollout, otherwise aborts. This example demonstrates: * the ability to invoke an analysis in-line as part of steps apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : guestbook spec : ... strategy : canary : steps : - setWeight : 20 - pause : { duration : 300 } - analysis : templateName : success-rate In this example, the AnalysisTemplate is identical to the background analysis example, but since no interval is specified, the analysis will perform a single measurement and complete. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AnalysisTemplate metadata : name : success-rate spec : inputs : - name : service-name metrics : - name : success-rate successCondition : result = 0.95 prometheus : address : http://prometheus.example.com:9090 query : | sum(irate( istio_requests_total{reporter= source ,destination_service=~ {{inputs.service-name}} ,response_code!~ 5.* }[5m] )) / sum(irate( istio_requests_total{reporter= source ,destination_service=~ {{inputs.service-name}} }[5m] )) Multiple measurements can be performed over a longer duration period, by specifying the count and interval fields: metrics : - name : success-rate successCondition : result = 0.95 interval : 60s count : 5 prometheus : address : http://prometheus.example.com:9090 query : ... Failure Conditions As an alternative to measuring success, failureCondition can be used to cause an analysis run to fail. The following example continually polls a prometheus server to get the total number of errors every 5 minutes, causing the analysis run to fail if 10 or more errors were encountered. metrics : - name : total-errors interval : 5m failureCondition : result = 10 failureLimit : 3 prometheus : address : http://prometheus.example.com:9090 query : | sum(irate( istio_requests_total{reporter= source ,destination_service=~ {{inputs.service-name}} ,response_code~ 5.* }[5m] )) Inconclusive Runs Analysis runs can also be considered Inconclusive , which indicates the run was neither successful, nor failed. Inconclusive runs causes a rollout to become paused at its current step. Manual intervention is then needed to either resume the rollout, or abort. One example of how analysis runs could become Inconclusive , is when a metric defines no success or failure conditions. metrics : - name : my-query prometheus : address : http://prometheus.example.com:9090 query : ... Inconclusive analysis runs might also happen when both success and failure conditions are specified, but the measurement value did not meet either condition. metrics : - name : success-rate successCondition : result = 0.90 failureCondition : result 0.50 prometheus : address : http://prometheus.example.com:9090 query : ... A use case for having Inconclusive analysis runs are to enable Argo Rollouts to automate the execution of analysis runs, and collect the measurement, but still allow human judgement to decide whether or not measurement value is acceptable and decide to proceed or abort. Experimentation (e.g. Mann-Whitney Analysis) Analysis can also be done as part of an Experiment. This example starts both a canary and baseline ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSets run for 1 hour, then scale down to zero. Call out to Kayenta to perform Mann-Whintney analysis against the two pods. Demonstrates ability to start a short-lived experiment and an asynchronous analysis.

Overview In addition to managing ReplicaSets, the rollout controller will modify a Service resource during the BlueGreenUpdate strategy. The Rollout spec has users specify a reference to active service and optionally a preview service in the same namespace. The active Service is used to send regular application traffic to the old version, while the preview Service is used as funnel traffic to the new version. The rollout controller ensures proper traffic routing by injecting a unique hash of the ReplicaSet to these services' selectors. This allows the rollout to define an active and preview stack and a process to migrate replica sets from the preview to the active. When there is a change to the .spec.template field of a rollout, the controller will create the new ReplicaSet. If the active service is not sending traffic to a ReplicaSet, the controller will immediately start sending traffic to the ReplicaSet. Otherwise, the active service will point at the old ReplicaSet while the ReplicaSet becomes available. Once the new ReplicaSet becomes available, the controller will modify the active service to point at the new ReplicaSet. After waiting some time configured by the .spec.strategy.blueGreen.scaleDownDelaySeconds , the controller will scale down the old ReplicaSet. Important note When the rollout changes the selector on a service, there is a propagation delay before all the nodes update their IP tables to send traffic to the new pods instead of the old. During this delay, traffic will be directed to the old pods if the nodes have not been updated yet. In order to prevent the packets from being sent to a node that killed the old pod, the rollout uses the scaleDownDelaySeconds field to give nodes enough time to broadcast the IP table changes. Configurable Features Here are the optional fields that will change the behavior of BlueGreen deployment: spec : strategy : blueGreen : previewService : string previewReplicaCount : *int32 autoPromotionEnabled : true autoPromotionSeconds : *int32 scaleDownDelaySeconds : *int32 scaleDownDelayRevisionLimit : *int32 PreviewService The PreviewService field references a Service that will be modified to send traffic to the new replicaset before the new one is promoted to receiving traffic from the active service. Once the new replicaset start receives traffic from the active service, the preview service will be modified to send traffic to no ReplicaSets. The Rollout always makes sure that the preview service is sending traffic to the new ReplicaSet. As a result, if a new version is introduced before the old version is promoted to the active service, the controller will immediately switch over to the new version. This feature is used to provide an endpoint that can be used to test a new version of an application. Defaults to an empty string PreviewReplicaCount The PreviewReplicaCount will indicate the number of replicas that the new version of an application should run. Once the application is ready to promote to the active service, the controller will scale the new ReplicaSet to the value of the spec.replicas . The rollout will not switch over the active service to the new ReplicaSet until it matches the spec.replicas count. This feature is mainly used to save resources during the testing phase. If the application does not need a fully scaled up application for the tests, this feature can help save some resources. Defaults to nil AutoPromotionEnabled The AutoPromotionEnabled will make the rollout automatically promote the new ReplicaSet to the active service once the new ReplicaSet is healthy. This field is defaulted to true if it is not specified. Defaults to true AutoPromotionSeconds The AutoPromotionSeconds will make the rollout automatically promote the new ReplicaSet to active Service after the AutoPromotionSeconds time has passed since the rollout has entered a paused state. If the AutoPromotionEnabled field is set to true, this field will be ignored Defaults to nil ScaleDownDelaySeconds The ScaleDownDelaySeconds is used to delay scaling down the old ReplicaSet after the active Service is switched to the new ReplicaSet.

Overview Since there is no agreed upon standard for a canary deployment, the rollouts controller allows users to outline how they want to run their canary deployment. Users can define a list of steps the controller uses to manipulate the RepliaSets where there is a change to the .spec.template . Each step will be evaluated before the new ReplicaSet is promoted to the stable version, and the old version is completely scaled down. Each step can have one of two fields. The setWeight field dictates the percentage of traffic that should be sent to the canary, and the pause struct instructs the rollout to pause. When the controller reaches a pause step for a rollout, it will set the .spec.paused field to true . If the duration field within the pause struct is set, the rollout will not progress to the next step until it has waited for the value of the duration field. Otherwise, the rollout will wait indefinitely until the .spec.paused field is set to false . By using the setWeight and the pause fields, a user can declarative describe how they want to progress to the new version. Below is an example of a canary strategy.

The Experiment CRD allows users to have ephemeral runs of one or more ReplicaSets. In addition to running ephemeral ReplicaSets, the Experiment CRD can launch AnalysisRuns alongside the ReplicaSets. Generally, those AnalysisRun is used to confirm that new ReplicaSets are running as expected. Use cases of the Experiment CRD A user wants to run two versions of an application for a specific duration to enable Kayenta-style analysis of their application. The Experiment CRD creates 2 ReplicaSets (a baseline and a canary) based on the spec.templates field of the Experiment and waits until both are healthy. After the duration passes, the Experiment scales down the ReplicaSets, and the user can start the Kayenta analysis run. A user can use experiments to enable A/B/C testing by launching multiple experiments with a different version of their application for a long duration. Each Experiment has one PodSpec template that defines a specific version a user would want to run. The Experiment allows users to launch multiple experiments at once and keep each Experiment self-contained. Launching a new version of an existing application with different labels to avoid receiving traffic from a Kubernetes service. The user can run tests against the new version before continuing the Rollout. Experiment Spec Below is an example of an experiment that creates two ReplicaSets with 1 replica each and runs them for 60 seconds once they both become available. Also, the controller launches two AnalysisRuns after the ReplicaSets become available. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Experiment metadata : name : example-experiment spec : duration : 60 # How long to run the Experiment once the ReplicaSets created from the templates are healthy progressDeadlineSeconds : 30 templates : - name : purple # (required) Unique name for the template that gets used as a part of the ReplicaSet name. replicas : 1 selector : # Same selector that has been as in Deployments and Rollouts matchLabels : app : canary-demo color : purple template : metadata : labels : app : canary-demo color : purple spec : # Same Pod Spec that has been as in Deployments and Rollouts containers : - name : rollouts-demo image : argoproj/rollouts-demo:purple imagePullPolicy : Always ports : - name : http containerPort : 8080 protocol : TCP - name : orange replicas : 1 minReadySeconds : 10 selector : # Same selector that has been as in Deployments and Rollouts matchLabels : app : canary-demo color : orange template : metadata : labels : app : canary-demo color : orange spec : # Same Pod Spec that has been as in Deployments and Rollouts containers : - name : rollouts-demo image : argoproj/rollouts-demo:orange imagePullPolicy : Always ports : - name : http containerPort : 8080 protocol : TCP analyses : - name : http-benchmarkple templateName : http-benchmark args : - name : host value : purple - name : orange templateName : http-benchmark args : - name : host value : orange How does it work? The Experiment controller has two primary responsibilities for each Experiment: Creating and scaling ReplicaSets Creating and watching AnalysisRuns The controller creates a ReplicaSet for each template in the Experiment's .spec.templates . Each template needs a unique name as the controller generates the ReplicaSet's names from the combination of the Experiment's name and template's name. Once the controller creates the ReplicaSets, it waits until those new ReplicaSets become available. Once all the ReplicaSets are available, the controller marks the Experiment as running. The Experiment stays in this state for the duration listed in the spec.duration field or indefinitely if omitted. Once the Experiment is running, the controller creates AnalysisRuns for each analysis listed in the Experiment's .spec.analysis field. These AnalysisRun execute in parallel with the running ReplicaSets. The controller generates the AnalysisRun's name by combining the experiment name and the analysis name with a dash. If an AnalysisRun exists with that name, the controller appends a number to the generated name before recreating the AnalysisRun. If there is another collision, the controller increments the number and try again until it creates an AnalysisRun. Once the Experiment finished, the controller scales down the ReplicaSets it created and terminates the AnalysisRuns if they have not finished. An Experiment is considered complete when: More than the spec.Duration amount of time has passed since the ReplicaSets became healthy. One of the ReplicaSets does not become available, and the progress deadline seconds pass. An AnalysisRun created by an Experiment enters a failed or error state. An external process (i.e. user or pipeline) sets the .spec.terminate to true Integration With Rollouts A rollout using the Canary strategy can create an experiment using the experiment step. The experiment step serves a blocking step for the Rollout as the Rollout does not continue until the Experiment succeeds. The Rollout creates an Experiment using the configuration in the experiment step of the Rollout. The controller generates the Experiment's name by combining the Rollout's name, the PodHash of the new ReplicaSet, the current revision of the Rollout, and the current step-index. If the Experiment fails or errors out, the Rollout enters an aborted state. While in the aborted state, the Rollout fully scales up the stable version and resets the current step index back to zero. Here is an example of a rollout with an experiment step: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : guestbook labels : app : guestbook spec : strategy : canary : steps : - experiment : duration : 3600 templates : - name : baseline specRef : stable replicas : 3 # optional defaults to 1 - name : canary specRef : canary analysis : templateName : mann-whitney arguments : - name : stable-hash valueFrom : podTemplateHash : baseline - name : canary-hash valueFrom : podTemplateHash : canary In the example above, the Experiment has two templates.

In order to accomplish this behavior, HPA only supports resources with the scale endpoint enabled with a couple of required fields. The scale endpoint allows the HPA to understand the current state of a resource and modify the resource to scale it appropriately. Argo Rollouts added support for the scale endpoint in the 0.3.0 release. After being modified by the HPA, the Argo Rollouts controller is responsible for reconciling that change in replicas. Since the strategies within a Rollout are very different, the Argo Rollouts controller handles the scale endpoint differently for various strategies. Below is the behavior for the different strategies: Blue Green The HPA will scale rollouts using the BlueGreen strategy using the metrics from the ReplicaSet receiving traffic from the active service. When the HPA changes the replicas count, the Argo Rollouts controller will first scale up the ReplicaSet receiving traffic from the active service before ReplicaSet receiving traffic from the preview service. The controller will scale up the ReplicaSet receiving traffic from the preview service to prepare it for when the rollout switches the preview to active. If there are no ReplicaSets receiving from the active service, the controller will use all the pods that match the base selector to determine scaling events. In that case, the controller will scale up the latest ReplicaSet to the new count and scale down the older ReplicaSets. Canary (ReplicaSet based) The HPA will scale rollouts using the Canary Strategy using the metrics of all the ReplicasSets within the rollout. Since the Argo Rollouts controller does not control the service that sends traffic to those ReplicaSets, it assumes that all the ReplicaSets in the rollout are receiving traffic.
